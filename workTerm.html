My supervisor was Dr. Charles Woods, and I was re-envisioning his website, to have a new way of presenting it.

I also made the template of the website including the menu, where I would add the buttons to be clicked on for each page of the website, such as In the Field, Advisory Board, etc. There was a total of 8 pages including the: Home Page, In the Field, Teaching Resources, Reading Lists, Using DRPC Resources Blog, Newsletter Digital Resources, Advisory Board, and Blog Changes. After hovering on the button for the page, there will be an underline, and after clicking on that page, there is an underline on that specific button, highlighting which page the user is on, from the website. I've also added the logo button in the menu for the homepage when you click on it. I also provided icons beside each title on each page. </p>

                                       <p> In week 2, I began working on the home page, the index.html, where I've added the logo, and description of the non-profit organization. I also added the events that the DRPC is recommending to go to, with the time, date, and location of the event, with a description of what the event is, alongside a poster of the event to attend to and a register link button for a total of 5 events in order by latest to most recent. The two events in the middle have a big poster image next to it. Then I've added a table at the bottom, where you can click on the event link, and it will take you to the section of the page, where you can register for it and where there is a description in the event in details. There are animations as the user scrolls through the page. This was different from their original home page which just had the events listed in one-column.

                                         <p> In week 4, the page that I worked on was the Advisory Board, where I added the updated members of the DRPCollective alongside the member's photo and their bio. I added myself as an intern. I created a function where I was able to toggle the members bio, so that when you click on read more under the person wanted to read more about, it displays their bio for that person clicked on. It also highlights the name of the person that is clicked on. I also made sure the images were all the same size, for the design. This was different from their original advisory board, which had the members listed and text beside it, in one-column. For week 4, I also worked on the Using Resources page, where I created a feature of having two coloums, where I added the ways how to cite using the DRPC resources that you use, and also how to input DRPC work into your portfolio. The cited part was in pre-source code format where the example was written to look in a different font with a darker background. I found an image for the front of the page, and I added a desciprtion of the page under the title. This was different from their using resources page where they had a bunch of text describing how to use their resources.

                            <p> For week 5, I was able to work on the Teaching Resources page, and Reading Lists page. For the Teaching Resources page, I had the description at the top, and then two columns. On the left column, provided a description of the teaching resource, and on the right, is in image to represent it, and a link where the user can preview the teaching resource. This was different from their original page of teaching resources, when they had two buttons one for Assignments, and the other for Readings, and then after clicking the Assignments it listed the assignments in pdf preview one under each other by one. For the Reading Lists page, I also had to create a new page, and there in two-colomns, listed each reading list, and under a description of the reading list, followed by the readings in that list. I also added images under the title of each reading list relating to that reading list topic. I provided a leave a review form at the bottom, where the user can leave a review of the reading list. This was different from the original reading list page, where they listed the readings in boxes.

There I added an image on top of the summary and a table of monthly blog posts calendar, where the reader can download the monthly blog posts. This was so that after reading the recent blog posts, the reader was able to view and download the monthly blog posts for each month. For the newsletter page, I was able to display a few of the recent newsletters in PDF, as well as recent newsletters on the right, and a monthly calendar to view the recent newsletters, as well as a monthly table to be able to download the newsletters for each month. When you click on the table, it displays only that month to be downloaded from the table. I did this so that the newsletters are presented to the reader in multiple ways for them to access depending on what they are looking for.This is a link to the updated blog page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcBlog.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcBlog.html</a> and this is their original blog page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/blog/">https://drpcollective.com/blog/</a> and this is the updated Newlsetters Page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcNewsletter.html"></a> and this is their original Newsletters page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/newsletter/">https://drpcollective.com/newsletter/</a> </p>

                                <hr />
							<h3>What I did During the Work Term:</h3>
                            <p> For the workterm, my project was to re-design the DRPCollective non-profit organization website, for usability, user engagement, presentation, style, and layout. My supervisor was Dr. Charles Woods, and I was re-envisioning his website, to have a new way of presenting it. This is a link to his original website:
                                <a href="https://drpcollective.com">https://drpcollective.com</a> and this is a link to the revised website for the DRPC that I worked on: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/</a>  </p>
                            <p> After deciding on a timeframe for the work to be done, we began the work on these following weeks with bi-weekly meetings for the progess of the project. Attatched is the schedule of the project: 
                           <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YA1S0-9VLcB3uJ30JjiNhA7As4ABhqTBOqpQfq3ExTE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YA1S0-9VLcB3uJ30JjiNhA7As4ABhqTBOqpQfq3ExTE/edit?usp=sharing</a>
                                <p></p>
                            <h2>Week 1</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> In week 1, I was responsible for choosing a template, and I chose the template from html5up.net, where I chose the template called Landed. I also made the template of the website including the menu, where I would add the buttons to be clicked on for each page of the website, such as In the Field, Advisory Board, etc. There was a total of 8 pages including the: Home Page, In the Field, Teaching Resources, Reading Lists, Using DRPC Resources Blog, Newsletter Digital Resources, Advisory Board, and Blog Changes. After hovering on the button for the page, there will be an underline, and after clicking on that page, there is an underline on that specific button, highlighting which page the user is on, from the website. I've also added the logo button in the menu for the homepage when you click on it. I also provided icons beside each title on each page. </p>
                                <p></p>
                            <h2> Week 2</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> In week 2, I began working on the home page, the index.html, where I've added the logo, and description of the non-profit organization. I also added the events that the DRPC is recommending to go to, with the time, date, and location of the event, with a description of what the event is, alongside a poster of the event to attend to and a register link button for a total of 5 events in order by latest to most recent. The two events in the middle have a big poster image next to it. Then I've added a table at the bottom, where you can click on the event link, and it will take you to the section of the page, where you can register for it and where there is a description in the event in details. There are animations as the user scrolls through the page. This was different from their original home page which just had the events listed in one-column. This is a link to the updated home page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/</a> and this is their original home page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/blog/">https://drpcollective.com/blog/</a>  </p>
                                <p></p>
                            <h2> Week 3</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> In week 3, I worked on DRPC In the Field page, where I added a feature which was text beside an image, alternating in a column, adding an image of an award, featuring their awards, and a grant, featuring their grants that they've received, alongside their presentations and a link to them, showcasing DRPC in the their field. This was different from the original home page because they had their awards, grants, and presentation listed in one column. This is a link to the updated \ page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcInTheField.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcInTheField.html</a> and this is their original home page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/drpc-in-the-field/">https://drpcollective.com/drpc-in-the-field/</a> </p>
                                <p></p>
                            <h2> Week 4</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> In week 4, the page that I worked on was the Advisory Board, where I added the updated members of the DRPCollective alongside the member's photo and their bio. I added myself as an intern. I created a function where I was able to toggle the members bio, so that when you click on read more under the person wanted to read more about, it displays their bio for that person clicked on. It also highlights the name of the person that is clicked on. I also made sure the images were all the same size, for the design. This was different from their original advisory board, which had the members listed and text beside it, in one-column. For week 4, I also worked on the Using Resources page, where I created a feature of having two coloums, where I added the ways how to cite using the DRPC resources that you use, and also how to input DRPC work into your portfolio. The cited part was in pre-source code format where the example was written to look in a different font with a darker background. I found an image for the front of the page, and I added a desciprtion of the page under the title. This was different from their using resources page where they had a bunch of text describing how to use their resources. This is a link to the updated Advisory Board page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/advisoryBoard.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/advisoryBoard.html</a> and this is their original Advisory Board page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/advisory-board/">https://drpcollective.com/advisory-board/</a> and this is a link to the updated Using Resources page:  <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcUsingResources.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcUsingResources.html</a> and this is their original Using Resources page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/using-drpc-resources/">https://drpcollective.com/using-drpc-resources/</a></p>

                                <p></p>
                            <p> For week 5, I was able to work on the Teaching Resources page, and Reading Lists page. For the Teaching Resources page, I had the description at the top, and then two columns. On the left column, provided a description of the teaching resource, and on the right, is in image to represent it, and a link where the user can preview the teaching resource. This was different from their original page of teaching resources, when they had two buttons one for Assignments, and the other for Readings, and then after clicking the Assignments it listed the assignments in pdf preview one under each other by one. For the Reading Lists page, I also had to create a new page, and there in two-colomns, listed each reading list, and under a description of the reading list, followed by the readings in that list. I also added images under the title of each reading list relating to that reading list topic. I provided a leave a review form at the bottom, where the user can leave a review of the reading list. This was different from the original reading list page, where they listed the readings in boxes. This is a link to the updated Teaching Resources page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcTeachingResources.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcTeachingResources.html</a> and this is their original Teaching Resources page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/assignments-activities/">https://drpcollective.com/assignments-activities//</a> This is a link to the updated Reading Lists page:  <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcReadingLists.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcReadingLists.html</a> and this is their original Reading Lists page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/reading-lists/">https://drpcollective.com/reading-lists/</a></p>
                                <p></p>
                            <h2> Week 6</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> For week 6, I worked on the blog and newsletter page.
                                For the blog, I created two coloumns, one that is bigger on the left and one that is smaller on the right to show the recent blog posts. Then, a summary for the reader to download the recent blog posts on the right. There I added an image on top of the summary and a table of monthly blog posts calendar, where the reader can download the monthly blog posts. This was so that after reading the recent blog posts, the reader was able to view and download the monthly blog posts for each month. For the newsletter page, I was able to display a few of the recent newsletters in PDF, as well as recent newsletters on the right, and a monthly calendar to view the recent newsletters, as well as a monthly table to be able to download the newsletters for each month. I did this so that the newsletters are presented to the reader in multiple ways for them to access depending on what they are looking for.This is a link to the updated blog page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcBlog.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcBlog.html</a> and this is their original blog page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/blog/">https://drpcollective.com/blog/</a> https://drpcollective.com/blog/ and this is the updated Newlsetters Page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcNewsletter.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/drpcNewsletter.html</a> and this is their original Newsletters page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/blog/">https://drpcollective.com/blog/</a> </p>

                            <h2> Week 7</h2>
                                <p></p>
                            <p> For week 7 I worked in digital resources page, and contacts us page. For the digital resources page, I created two columns where it would feature the digital resources. I did this so that the page looks like there are multiple digital resources presented to the author in a visual appealing way. This is a link to the updated Digital Resources page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/digitalResources.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/digitalResources.html</a> and this is their original Digital Resources: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/drpc-digital-resources/">https://drpcollective.com/drpc-digital-resources/</a>  and This is a link to the updated Contacts Us page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/contacts.html">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/contacts.html</a> and this is their original Contacts Us page <a href="https://drpcollective.com/contact/">https://drpcollective.com/contact/</a></p>

                                <p></p>
                            <p> For week 8, I worked on recent changes page. On this page I was able to summarize the changes and why I made them to the website in a form of a blog post. I added an image of pheonix code, because that was the main platform I was working on.This is a link to the updated \ page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/</a> and this is their original page: <a href="https://drpcollective.com/blog/">https://drpcollective.com/blog/</a> https://drpcollective.com/blog/</p>

                                <p></p>
                                <p> For week 9, I began making final edits to the website, such as making sure all the menu highlights such as putting class=active on that specific link on the menu. As well as making sure the links work, formatting, and removing any extra text.

                                <p> For week 10, I began to continue editing the website for final looks, and cohesiveness across the website.This is a link to the updated \ page: <a href="https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/">https://bella5695.github.io/DRPC/</a></p>

								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Isabelle Yam                </strong></h1>
                            </header> <strong> Biography:</strong>
                            <p></p>
							<p> I'm a 4th-year student in Professional Writing at York University. As a professional writer and content creator, I value design which is creating content and presenting it in a visually appealing way for others to view the information. </p>
                            <p>My interests are graphic design,  programming, and writing books because I like visual arts in creating artworks that allow me to express my creativity in a visual way. </p>
                            <h3><a ref="" id="textIsHidden" onclick ="myFunction('me');">more...</a></h3>
                            <p id="myIntro1"> I like graphic design because I like to design images that present information, and allow me to create my own artworks, and other things that allow me to express my thought processes. </p>
                           <p id="myIntro2"> I also like programming because it involves coming up with ways that people can implement and execute code to be able to use technology to create fascinating digital things. Coding is relevant in today’s world where there is a lot of digital technology, and it seems like it is able to create new things using technology. I really admire coding and programming, such as being able to design your own website, through code, and placing things. As a writer, I think that working with other digital programmers would be helpful in publishing your work online, and getting to be able to publish content online. </p>
                           <p id="myIntro3">Lastly, I enjoy writing books and coming up with stories, such as authors who have written their books, and stories. Some of my favourite books have been Harry Potter, and ShadowHunters which were new, immersive worlds that were like a new world within a book, so it was very cool to read, and get insight into a new creative world that the author was creating. I would also like to publish my own book one day, and create my own fictional world. I enjoy reading realistic fiction and fantasy.</p>
